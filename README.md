# Solidity Game - Double Entry Point

_Inspired by OpenZeppelin's [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com), DoubleEntryPoint Level_

⚠️Do not try on mainnet!

## Task

This level features a `CryptoVault` with special functionality, the `sweepToken` function. This is a common function to retrieve tokens stuck in a contract. The `CryptoVault` operates with an `underlying` token that can't be swept, being it an important core's logic component of the `CryptoVault`, any other token can be swept.

The underlying token is an instance of the DET token implemented in `DoubleEntryPoint` contract definition and the `CryptoVault` holds 100 units of it. Additionally the `CryptoVault` also holds 100 of `LegacyToken LGT`.

In this level you should figure out where the bug is in `CryptoVault` and protect it from being drained out of tokens.

The contract features a `Forta` contract where any user can register its own `detection bot` contract. Forta is a decentralized, community-based monitoring network to detect threats and anomalies on DeFi, NFT, governance, bridges and other Web3 systems as quickly as possible. Your job is to implement a `detection bot` and register it in the `Forta` contract. The bot's implementation will need to raise correct alerts to prevent potential attacks or bug exploits.

_Hint:_

1. How does a double entry point work for a token contract?
2. Do not care about `sweptTokensRecipient`, focus on preventing `DET` transfer from `CryptoVault`.

## What will you learn?

1. [Layout of Call Data](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.3/internals/layout_in_calldata.html)
2. Encoding/Decoding message data

## What is the most difficult challenge?

**Let's make a watcher bot** 🤖

You need to learn more about Forta. But it's out of this game's scope.

**ABI Encoder v2** 🤔

> The Contract Application Binary Interface (ABI) is the standard way to interact with contracts in the Ethereum ecosystem, both from outside the blockchain and for contract-to-contract interaction. Data is encoded according to its type, as described in this specification. The encoding is not self describing and thus requires a schema in order to decode.
>
> We assume the interface functions of a contract are strongly typed, known at compilation time and static. We assume that all contracts will have the interface definitions of any contracts they call available at compile-time.

Understand the encoding rule of function parameters and use this knowledge to get the correct data offset you want to get in `calldata`.

i.e. Layout of calldata when `function handleTransaction(address user, bytes calldata msgData) external;` is called.

| calldata offset | length | element                                | type    | example value                                                      |

## Configuration

### Install Dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

## Test and Attack!💥

### Run Tests

```sh
yarn compile
yarn test
```

You should see the result like following:

```sh
  DetectionBot
    √ should set up a detection bot
    √ should allow sweep other token
    √ should not allow sweep DET token

  3 passing (2s)

```
